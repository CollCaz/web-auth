# Create Verification

üë®‚Äçüíº This is going to feel pretty similar to what we've done before, with an
interesting twist. The verification we make at first is what we're going to call
a "verify" verification, meaning, it's a verification that needs to be verified
before it can be used. The `type` is `2fa-verify`.

When the user clicks "Enable 2FA," the `action` is called and we create a TOTP
with `generateTOTP` from `@epic-web/totp`. We then save the verification
configuration into the database. We're going to want to include an `expiresAt`
on this so if the user takes too long to verify, we can safely delete it and
require that they go through the process again.

With that created, we'll send them over to
the <LinkToApp to="/settings/profile/two-factor/verify" /> route which will be
similar to the regular `/verify` route, but is special for this type of
verification.

	It's important to note that most 2FA apps only support the SHA1 algorithm and
	a `charSet` of `0123456789`. For that reason `@epic-web/totp` defaults to
	those values. So we don't need to configure those, but you will still want to
	save them to the database.

That's as far as we're going to get in this step. Enjoy!
