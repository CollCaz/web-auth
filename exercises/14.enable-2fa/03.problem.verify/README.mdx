# Verify Code

üë®‚Äçüíº If you have a phone that can scan the QR code (or the 1Password desktop app
can scan the code on your screen), you can use this to generate a code.
Otherwise, you can actually just use this script to do it as well:

```tsx
import { generateTOTP } from '@epic-web/totp'

// Paste your string here. It should start with "otpauth://totp/" and include a secret and other params
const otpString = ``

const otpUri = new URL(otpString)
const { secret, algorithm, digits, period } = Object.fromEntries(
	otpUri.searchParams.entries(),
)

const { otp } = generateTOTP({
	secret,
	algorithm,
	digits,
	period,
})

console.log(otp)
```

<InlineFile file="otp.js">Create a file called `otp.js`</InlineFile> and then you
can paste that code in there and run `node otp.js` to get the code.

Paste the URI in there and run the script, it will output the code which you can
use to test things out.

In this one you'll want to start in the `action`
of <InlineFile file="app/routes/settings+/profile.two-factor.verify.tsx" />.
You'll first verify the code, and then you can update the verification in the
database to go from the `2fa-verify` `type` to a regular `2fa` `type` and remove
the `expiresAt`.

This will involve creating a new verification type for `2fa` so our `/verify`
route can handle that, so you'll be working
in <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/verify.tsx" /> as well.

Finally, you'll need to update the <LinkToApp to="/settings/profile" /> route so
it shows whether 2FA is enabled or not as well
as <LinkToApp to="/settings/profile/two-factor" />.

Once you're done, we still won't actually ask the user to verify with their 2FA
code when they login yet, but you should be able to enable 2FA on an account and
have that reflected in the settings page.

<callout-warning>
	Once you enable it, we don't have the ability to disable it yet, so if you
	need to do that, you can always run `npx prisma db seed` to reseed the
	database if you need.
