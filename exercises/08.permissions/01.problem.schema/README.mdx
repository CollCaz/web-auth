# Roles Schema

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/authentication-strategies-and-implementation/permissions/implementing-role-based-access-control-with-prisma" />

👨‍💼 Let's role-up our users.

...

Was that a bad dad joke?

Anyway...

Users have roles, roles have permissions, and permissions can be assigned to
roles. So we are going to have the following relationships:

- many-to-many: User has many roles, roles can be assigned to many users
- many-to-many: Role has many permissions and permissions can be assigned to
  many roles

As a reminder, Prisma manages the many-to-many relational table for you, so you
just create the models with the relationships and Prisma will take care of the
rest.

🐨 Update the schema in <InlineFile file="prisma/schema.prisma" />

Then run the migration to create a migration file and apply it to the database:

```sh nonumber
npx prisma migrate dev --name roles
```
