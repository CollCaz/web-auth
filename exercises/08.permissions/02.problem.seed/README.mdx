# Roles Seed

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/authentication-strategies-and-implementation/permissions/managing-roles-and-permissions" />

👨‍💼 Perhaps in the future we'll want pretty fine-grained roles and permissions,
but for now we really only have two roles:

1. `admin` - which can do anything to everything
2. `user` - which can do anything to their own data

Our <InlineFile file="prisma/seed.ts" /> script should create these roles and
permissions, and assign the "user" roles to the generated users and the "admin"
role to the `Kody` user.

Once you've finished updating the seed script, run it with:

```sh nonumber
npx prisma db seed
```

But before we wrap this up, you'll want to make sure we create all new users
with the `user` role, otherwise new users won't have the right permissions!

We do that in <InlineFile file="app/utils/auth.server.ts" />, so get that
updated too please.
