# Permissions Utils

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/authentication-strategies-and-implementation/permissions/securing-admin-pages-with-user-permissions" />

👨‍💼 It would be great to have some nicer utilities for determining a user's
access to perform actions on an entity. So Kellie 🧝‍♂️ put some together
in <InlineFile file="app/utils/permissions.ts" />. I'll let Kellie explain how
it works.

🧝‍♂️ Thanks Peter. Yeah, so there are now a few utilities you can use in the
permissions module. Here's how you can use them:

```tsx lines=3,11,24,31
// requireUserWithPermission
export async function loader({ request }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
	const userId = await requireUserWithPermission(request, 'update:user:own')
	// it throws an error response if the user doesn't have this permission, so
	// if you make it this far, you know they have it.

	// ... do stuff
}

export async function action({ request }: ActionFunctionArgs) {
	const userId = await requireUserWithRole(request, 'admin')
	// it throws an error response if the user doesn't have this role, so
	// if you make it this far, you know they have it.

	// NOTE: use this sparingly. It's better to use requireUserWithPermission
	// because if we ever change permissions for a role they may no longer have
	// access to perform this action.

	// ... do stuff
}

function SomeRoute() {
	const user = useOptionalUser()
	const canCreateOwnNotes = userHasPermission(user, 'create:note:own')

	// ... do stuff
}

function SomeRoute() {
	const user = useOptionalUser()
	const isAdmin = userHasRole(user, 'admin')

	// ... do stuff
}
```

Also, you can set the access to comma-separated accesses if you need.

```tsx
// if the user is the owner, then they need to have "own" access
// if they're not, they need to have "any" access
await requireUserWithPermission(request, `update:note:any,own`)
// 🦉 we'll not be using this feature of the util today though.
```

One thing is the `userHasRole` and `userHasPermission` functions rely on user
data loaded in the root loader and I haven't done that yet, so you'll need to
handle that before you can use these utilities.

👨‍💼 Thanks for building those utilities Kellie!

🐨 Ok, so before you can actually start using these utilities, you need to add
the permissions to the user query in <InlineFile file="app/root.tsx" />.

🐨 While you're there, you may as well finish the user admin role work by updating
the App component with a `userIsAdmin` variable and locking down
the <InlineFile file="app/routes/admin.tsx" /> route.

🦺 If you want to, you can remove the `ts-ignore`s
in <InlineFile file="app/utils/permissions.ts" /> now that the root loader is
loading the user's permissions.

🐨 With that done, now you need to update
the <InlineFile file="app/routes/users+/$username_+/notes.$noteId.tsx" /> route
to use these utilities instead of what you did last time.
