üë®‚Äçüíº Great work. There are lots of different ways to accomplish this, but it's
important that we have a standard way to handle permissions in our own
application.

As mentioned, there is definitely opportunity to improve this with a custom
[Prisma client extension](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions).
If you figure out a good solution for that, let us know!

ü¶â It should be mentioned that our approach works because we allow admins to
also be users (we added both roles to the Kody user). However, if you wanted to
not add the user role to the admin, you would need to do one of two things:

1. Make sure the admin role also gets permissions to modify their `own` entities
2. Adjust the application code to use `own` OR `any` permissions. Like so:

```ts
await requireUserWithPermission(
	request,
	isOwner ? `update:note:any,own` : `update:note:any`,
)
```

If you ask me, you should probably just make admins users as well. But, making
the admin role also get permissions to modify their `own` entities makes sense
as well.
