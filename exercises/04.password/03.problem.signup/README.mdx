# Sign Up

👨‍💼 Let's create a password record when we create a new user so that can be used
when the user logs in. Jump into <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/signup.tsx" />
and follow the emoji.

Once you've done that, head to <LinkToApp to="/signup" /> and try signing up a
new account. It should allow you to sign in and then you can check the database
for the password if you'd like to make sure it worked:

```sh nonumber
npx prisma studio
```
