# Seeding Password Hashes

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/authentication-strategies-and-implementation/password/generating-passwords-for-secure-user-creation" />

👨‍💼 We're going to start with the seed script. Sadly, because the database can't
enforce that every user has a password, Prisma won't let us know if we ever
create a user without one either. It's possible we could create a
[Prisma client extension](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions)
to help with this, but for now we'll just deal with the fact that we're not
getting type errors in our seed script even though we're not adding passwords
to the users we're generating.

To generate a hash, we'll use the `bcrypt` library. For our seed/test utils,
we're ok just using the synchronous version (we'll use the async version in the
app):

```ts
import bcrypt from 'bcryptjs'

bcrypt.hashSync(password, 10)
```

The `10` there is the number of rounds of hashing to do. The higher the number,
the longer it takes to generate the hash, but the harder it is to crack. 10 is
a reasonable number for our use case.

So follow the emoji's instructions in <InlineFile file="tests/db-utils.ts" />
to make a utility for creating a password field, then
update the <InlineFile file="prisma/seed.ts" /> script to use that utility.

🐨 once you're done with this, you can run the seed to get the passwords in
there:

```sh nonumber
npx prisma db seed
```

If you'd like, you can check hashes in prisma studio:

```sh nonumber
npx prisma studio
```

The first 30 characters of the hash are the auto-generated salt, and the rest is
the actual hash of the password.
