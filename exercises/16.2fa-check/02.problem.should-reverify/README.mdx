# Should Reverify

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/authentication-strategies-and-implementation/two-factor-authentication-check/adding-user-re-verification-for-critical-operations" />

👨‍💼 We need to keep track of when the user last submitted their 2FA code. We'll
store this in the `cookieSession` under `'verified-time'`.

Then we'll implement a utility called `shouldRequestTwoFA` which will return
`true` if the user should be asked to verify their 2FA code because it's been
too long since they last verified. We're defining "too long" as "two hours."

Once you have that implemented, you can actually use it in the `action` to
determine whether the user who's logging in should be redirected to the
`/verify` route before logging in or not.

The emoji will guide you 🐨 Enjoy!
