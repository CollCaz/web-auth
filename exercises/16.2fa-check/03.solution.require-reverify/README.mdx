👨‍💼 Awesome! Now we can apply this to other places. If you'd like, you can move
the utility you just wrote
into <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/verify.tsx" /> so you can reuse it
in <InlineFile file="app/routes/settings+/profile.change-email.tsx" />.
Otherwise Kellie 🧝‍♂️ will <DiffLink>do it for you</DiffLink>.

But we're not totally done. We actually have an issue we need to address with
session expiration...
