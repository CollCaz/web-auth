# Require Reverification

👨‍💼 Before we allow the user to delete their 2FA verification, let's determine
whether they should re-verify their account.

You're going to make a `requireRecentVerification` utility which will use the
`shouldRequestTwoFA` utility you just implemented in the login route. Then you
can use that in both the `loader` and `action` of the disable 2FA route to force
the user to re-verify before they can disable 2FA.
