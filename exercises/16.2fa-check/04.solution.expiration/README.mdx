👨‍💼 I hope you enjoyed some of those JavaScript gymnastics 🤸 This works out
nicely now so we don't have to worry about overriding the expiration date of a
cookie. It just keeps the most recent expiration date it was set to. Well done!

🧝‍♂️ I'm going to prepare us for the next exercise. I'm going to make another
session storage called `connectionSessionStorage`
in a new file at <InlineFile file="app/utils/connections.server.ts" />. I'm also
going to make a "Login with GitHub" form
at <InlineFile file="app/utils/connections.tsx" />. I'm going to keep it generic
because we want to be able to support more than just GitHub.
