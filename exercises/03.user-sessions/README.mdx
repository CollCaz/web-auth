# User Session

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/authentication-strategies-and-implementation/user-sessions/intro-to-user-sessions" />

This exercise will build on the knowledge you developed from the previous
exercise on Remix's session storage utilities for storing data in cookies.
Again, there are other storage mechanisms available, and if you need to track a
lot of data for the user, you may consider using one of those other mechanisms.
In each of those cases, a cookie is still used to keep track of the user's
session, but the data is stored in a database/filesystem/etc.

For us, we're not going to be storing enough data in the session to warrant
using a different storage mechanism. In [the future](/09) though, we will be
creating a database table for managed sessions, but we'll get to that later.

You'll be creating a separate cookie for this session storage with its own
expiration characteristics and other configuration. We're going to call this
`sessionStorage` and the value you get from calling `getSession()` will be
`cookieSession` to differentiate it from the managed session we'll bring in
later. You may also consider calling it `authSessionStorage` and `authSession`
to be more explicit about what it's used for.

In this exercise, you're going to be using that session storage to store the
`userId` of the user who's currently logged in. Because it's cryptographically
signed, the user won't be able to tamper with it, so we can trust it as an
authentication mechanism. If the user is logged in, we'll be able to get their
`userId` from the `cookieSession` and use it to load their user record from the
database.

The basic login flow is:

1. Find user
2. Verify password (coming soon)
3. Set userId in `cookieSession`
4. Get the userId from the `cookieSession`
5. Load the user by their ID
