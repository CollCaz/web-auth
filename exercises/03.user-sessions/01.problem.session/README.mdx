# Session Storage

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/authentication-strategies-and-implementation/user-sessions/managing-user-sessions-with-separate-cookies" />

👨‍💼 Just like with the toast messages, we're going to want to use the
[`createCookieSessionStorage` API](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/utils/sessions#createcookiesessionstorage)
to create a session storage object that we can use to store and retrieve the
`userId`.

We'll make this a different one from the toast messages so that we can keep them
separate. We'll call this one simply `sessionStorage`.

🐨 Please <InlineFile file="app/utils/session.server.ts">Create `app/utils/session.server.ts`</InlineFile>
to initialize this session storage object.

🐨 This session should have a very similar configuration to the toast messages
session. The only difference is the `name` should be `'en_session'` to avoid
clashing with the toast messages session.

(If you need a reminder, check <InlineFile file="app/utils/toast.server.ts" />).

Make sure you export the `sessionStorage` object from this module.

There's not a great way to test that you've got this done correctly until the
next step, so you <Link to="?preview=diff">may check the diff</Link> to
make sure you got it right before moving on.
