# Theme Cookie

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/authentication-strategies-and-implementation/cookies/adding-user-preference-for-dark-mode" />

👨‍💼 Let's start working with the theme cookie.

We want the user to be able to choose between light and dark mode. Our
application is already set up to handle this via a class name on the `<html>`
element (put `light` or `dark` in the class name and the UI will update through
the magic of CSS Custom Properties + Tailwind).

So all we need to do is finish the implementation
of <InlineFile file="app/utils/theme.server.ts" /> and then finish wiring things
up in <InlineFile file="app/root.tsx" />.

👨‍💼 When you've finished, you should be able to click the icon in the bottom
right to update the theme. You'll notice a network request each time you click
it so the server can update the cookie. You should see the `set-cookie` header
