# Optimistic Theme

üë®‚Äçüíº Wow! That's a huge improvement for users with a slow network. And we didn't
have to compromise on the capabilities of our theme solution.

Cookies sure are neat!

ü¶â [Remix version 2.2.0](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/releases/tag/remix%402.2.0)
added a new feature which makes implementing this even easier. You can now
provide a [`key`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/hooks/use-fetcher#key) to the
`useFetcher` hook and then use that same key to find the fetcher. So you could
do something like this:

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/tips/use-fetcher-keys-for-registering-remix-fetchers" />

Here's some updated code:

```tsx lines=1,5,14 nonumber
const themeFetcherKey = 'theme-fetcher'

function useTheme() {
	const data = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()
	const themeFetcher = useFetcher<typeof action>({ key: themeFetcherKey })
	const optimisticTheme = themeFetcher.formData?.get('theme')
	if (optimisticTheme === 'light' || optimisticTheme === 'dark') {
		return optimisticTheme
	}
	return data.theme
}

function ThemeSwitch({ userPreference }: { userPreference?: Theme }) {
	const fetcher = useFetcher<typeof action>({ key: themeFetcherKey })
	// ...
}
```

ü¶â If you want to take this further and implement the user's preference as a
default theme, you can try that! It's just a little outside the scope of this
auth workshop, so we'll leave that to you as a side-quest. You'll face an issue
where the user's preference can't be known server-side. However, if you
implement Client Hints, you can overcome that issue. Watch this tip from Kent to
learn about Client hints:
