We've already discussed verifying the user's password in the previous exercise,
so there's not much to add at a fundamental level to the background of this
exercise.

We also already implemented loading the user's data once they have the proper
session cookie.

So this exercise is really just a matter of verifying the user's password before
setting the session cookie and then creating some utilities to make accessing
the user information in the UI easier.

## Verifying the password

Because we're generating the hash and salt using `bcrypt`, we simply take the
`hash` we stored and pass it to `bcrypt` along with the provided password to
verify that the password is correct.

```ts
import bcrypt from 'bcryptjs'

const isValid = await bcrypt.compare(password, hash)
```

`bcrypt` will take care of splitting the hash into it's salt and hash parts and
then hashing the provided password with the salt to see if it matches.

## Remix Route Data

One important thing to understand about the way Remix nested routes is that
all the UI for child routes have access to the data returned by their parent
routes as well. This means that the UI of the child routes should not need to
get any user information from the server that's made available by the root
route.

You can access the data from parent routes using
[the `useRouteLoaderData` hook](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/hooks/use-route-loader-data).
For example:

```tsx
const { user } = useRouteLoaderData('root')
```

To make this type-safe, you can get the loader and pass it to the hook as a
generic:

```tsx
const { user } = useRouteLoaderData<typeof rootLoader>('root')
```

## Optional Users

Many applications have parts of the UI that are shown to only anonymous users
(login, signup, etc), parts of the UI that are shown only to authenticated
(settings, etc), and parts of the UI that are shown to both (home page, etc).

So normally your `user` data can be the `User` object or `undefined`. But this
can be annoying on pages where you know the user is logged in, because you have
to check if the user is `undefined` before you can access the user's data.

So, to combat this, you can create two hooks:

- `useOptionalUser` - returns the user if they're logged in, or `undefined` if
  they're not (used for pages that are shown to both authenticated and
  unauthenticated users).
- `useUser` - returns the user if they're logged in, or throws an error if
  they're not (used for pages that are shown only to authenticated users).

This way if the user data is unavailable, you can get a nice error message
instead of "Cannot read property 'name' of undefined". And on top of that
TypeScript will know that the user is not `undefined` when you use the
`useUser` hook, so you don't have to do any extra checks.
