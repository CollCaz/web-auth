# UI Utils

👨‍💼 The user's information is something we'll want to access throughout the app
UI. So I want you to create a couple of handy utilities to help us do that.

🐨 Start out by making the utilities in <InlineFile file="app/utils/user.ts" />,
then go through the rest of the files (in the files menu below) to use the
utilities you make.

For this first bit, we don't have any authenticated-only pages yet, but we'll
get there soon.

As a reminder, you can get the root loader's data like so:

```tsx
const { user } = useRouteLoaderData<typeof rootLoader>('root')
```

To test out that this worked, sign in as a user (for example, username `kody`
and password `kodylovesyou`) and check the affected routes. Then open (in
another browser) those routes to check the unauthenticated experience.
