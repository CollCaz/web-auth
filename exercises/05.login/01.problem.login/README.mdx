👨‍💼 Let's verify the password now!

```ts
import { bcrypt } from '#app/utils/auth.server.ts'

const isValid = await bcrypt.compare(password, hash)
```

Please add some logic to the <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/login.tsx" />
file to verify the user's password. You'll need to get the user's hash, and take
care to not return the hash to the browser.

You can test this out by going to <LinkToApp to="/users" />, choosing a random
user, and trying to log in with their password (which is equal to their
username). Or you can login as Kody:

- `username`: `kody`
- `password`: `kodylovesyou`

Make sure to test out the error case as well!

	Since we haven't implemented logout yet, you may need to clear your cookies
	before you can test out the error case 😅
