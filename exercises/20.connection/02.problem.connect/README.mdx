# Add Connection

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/authentication-strategies-and-implementation/connection-management/adding-multiple-github-connections-to-user-accounts" />

👨‍💼 Now we want users to be able to add new connections from
their <LinkToApp to="/settings/profile/connections" /> page.

The rules are pretty simple... If there is no existing connection, but there is
a user authenticated, then create the connection, and send them to the
connections page with a toast message letting them know it was successful.

Because we already handled error cases before, this should be a quick one!

🧝‍♂️ I've updated the `code`
in <InlineFile file="app/utils/providers/github.server.ts" /> to be for a GitHub
user that doesn't have a connection yet. You can use this to test your code.
If you want to test another user, then change the `code` and you should be set.
