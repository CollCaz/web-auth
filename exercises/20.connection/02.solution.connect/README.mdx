# Add Connection

👨‍💼 Great job! Our third party authentication flow is complete. Now that we have
all of this set up, it's trivial to add more third parties!

For example,
[checkout the OpenID Connect Example](https://github.com/kentcdodds/epic-oidc)!

Another thing you'll want to consider with this is now we have some users who
do not have passwords. We allow users to delete their connections, but if they
delete them all and they haven't added a password, they'll lose access to their
account!

Kellie 🧝‍♂️ already put in place a protection to prevent users deleting all their
connections if they haven't added a password yet, but if you'd like to add a
`/settings/profile/password/create` route for users to add a password, that
would be super. If not, <DiffLink>Kellie 🧝‍♂️ will do it</DiffLink>.
