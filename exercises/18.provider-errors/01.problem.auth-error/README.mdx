# Auth Errors

👨‍💼 We have to mitigate our risks and we know that GitHub isn't perfect. It does
go down occasionally, so we want to gracefully fail in this situation.

There's not much we can do in the event of a third party failure, so you can
just redirect the user to `/login` and show the user a toast message letting
them know of the error.

🧝‍♂️ I've put a comment in <InlineFile file="tests/mocks/github.ts" line={136} />
you can uncomment to test this out.
