# Connection Errors

At times there are issues connecting user accounts, and this is a quick exercise
in handling those effectively so we don't end up in a funny state. It could be
that the actual connection process with the provider is at fault, or maybe the
user's trying to connect an account that's already connected to another user's
account.

These are the cases we're going to handle gracefully in this exercise. Enjoy!
