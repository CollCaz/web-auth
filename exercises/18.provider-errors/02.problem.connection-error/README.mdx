# Connection Exceptions

üë®‚Äçüíº Because of the <LinkToApp to="/settings/profile/connections" /> page, users
can connect multiple third party accounts to their profile. But we don't allow
a third party account to be connected to more than one profile. If we did, how
would we know which profile the user is trying to login with?

So we need to make sure users can't connect a third party account to their
account if it's already connected to another user's account (even if its their
own üòÖ).

So in this step, you need to search the database for an existing connection and
you'll get the `userId` from the request. If there's a connection and there's a
`userId`, then they're trying to connect an account that has already been
connected and we should show an error in that case.

üßù‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è With the way I put the mocks together, you'll get a different GitHub user if
you change the `code` in `handleMockAction`
in <InlineFile file="app/utils/providers/github.server.ts" />. And our seed
script initializes a github user for Kody as well. So the code
`MOCK_GITHUB_CODE_KODY` will connect you to the profile that is already
connected to Kody. So to test this, try the following:

1. Sign in as Kody (username: `kody`, password: `kodylovesyou`)
1. Go to <LinkToApp to="/settings/profile/connections" />
1. Make sure `code` is set to `MOCK_GITHUB_CODE_KODY`
   in <InlineFile file="app/utils/providers/github.server.ts" />
1. Click "Connect with GitHub"

You should get an error indicating this account is already connected to you.

Then, change `code`
in <InlineFile file="app/utils/providers/github.server.ts" /> to
`MOCK_GITHUB_CODE_KODY2`, and try again.

This should send you to `/login`, but because you're already logged in, you'll
ultimately get sent to `/`. We still need to implement connecting the account,
so we're good here.

Now if you want to test the other case...

1. change `code`
   in <InlineFile file="app/utils/providers/github.server.ts" /> back to
   `MOCK_GITHUB_CODE_KODY`
1. Logout of kody on <LinkToApp to="/users/kody" />
1. Go to <LinkToApp to="/users" />
1. Choose any user, copy their username
1. Go to <LinkToApp to="/login" />
1. Enter the copied username in the username and password fields
1. Go to <LinkToApp to="/settings/profile/connections" />
1. Click "Connect with GitHub"

You should get an error indicating that the GitHub account is already connected
to another account.
