# Auth Utils

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/authentication-strategies-and-implementation/managed-sessions/implementing-session-based-authentication" />

👨‍💼 This is a pretty significant change to our auth model. So we're going to
break this next bit into two steps:

1. Updating the auth utils
2. Updating the `/login` and `/signup` routes.

For this step, let's just update the auth utils. Everywhere we're querying for
the user based on the `userId` in the request, we'll instead query the session
table with the `sessionId` in the request.

We'll also want to make sure when the user logs out we delete their old session.
