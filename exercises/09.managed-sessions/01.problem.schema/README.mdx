# Sessions Schema

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/authentication-strategies-and-implementation/managed-sessions/managing-user-sessions-and-allowing-data-downloads" />

👨‍💼 Before we can start managing sessions, we need to update our schema to add
the session model. Once you get that done, then add a migration for this change:

```sh nonumber
npx prisma migrate dev --name sessions
```

We won't need to seed the database with sessions though.
