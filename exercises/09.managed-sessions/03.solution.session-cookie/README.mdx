👨‍💼 Great! Now we've got the ability to allow people to delete their other
sessions!

🧝‍♂️ I'm going to update the <LinkToApp to="/settings/profile" /> page to add the
UI to prepare for your changes. I'm also going to re-use our `logout` utility in
the `getUserId` function in the case there's no user attached to the session.
