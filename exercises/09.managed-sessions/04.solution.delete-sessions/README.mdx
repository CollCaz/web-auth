# Delete Sessions

👨‍💼 Terrific job! We're now managing sessions for our user so we have a lot more
control over our sessions and when they expire. This also allows us to
proactively log out a user if they change their password if we so desire.

Great work. 👏👏

🦉 You may have noticed an edge case we did not resolve. If a user does not
check the "Remember Me" checkbox, then their browser cookie could be deleted
before the session in the database expires. This would leave a session in the
database that will never be accessed. Which will mean the user could see a count
of sessions which is technically incorrect.

Unfortunately, there's no way for us to know if a user has deleted their cookie.
Even if they do check "Remember Me," they can clear their cookies at any time.
This is just a problem without a solution. Luckily it's not really a big deal.
