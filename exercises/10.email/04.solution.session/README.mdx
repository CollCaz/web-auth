# Pass Data Between Routes

üë®‚Äçüíº Awesome work! We now have a safe and secure mechanism for storing temporary
verification data in the user's session. But we do still need to _actually_
verify the user's email address. That'll come next!

üßù‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I'm going to make a new route `/verify` which we'll be using for users to
enter a special code we'll send them. It's work you've done before so I'll do it
for you (unless you've got extra time and want to do it yourself). The basic
idea is it just accepts a `code` query parameter and if that's already provided
(because they clicked on a link), then we'll check it and if it's valid, we'll
continue to the "next step" (which you will build), otherwise we'll show them
the form and allow them to enter the code.

We're also going to have a "target" field which is a hidden field and you'll
learn more about that in the next exercise. Oh, and a `redirectTo` hidden field
as well which will come in handy. See you soon!
