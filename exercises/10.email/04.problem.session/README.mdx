# Pass Data Between Routes

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/authentication-strategies-and-implementation/email/secure-email-transfer-and-storage-with-cookies-for-onboarding" />

🦉 Normally when you want to pass data in a React application you start reaching
for things like context or other libraries. The problem with this is in our case
the user could actually navigate away from the site to check their email and get
the code or link we've sent them. So you can't do that!

So instead, we're going to use a cookie session. But we don't want to re-use the
existing user session for this because we want this session to be short-lived.
It should expire after only 10 minutes. We're going to call this our
`verifySession` which we'll use for all sorts of verifications in the future.

👨‍💼 Thanks Olivia. Ok, so now we need you to create a new session storage object
(you should be a pro at that by now), and then use that when you send the email
to set the email address they signed up with.

Then when they get to the onboarding page we can get the email they signed up
with out of the session and proceed with the onboarding.

I should note that we're not _quite_ going to get to actually _verifying_ the
user's email just yet. That will come in the next exercise. But hopefully this
gives you an idea of how to communicate state between routes!

I suggest you start in <InlineFile file="app/utils/verification.server.ts" />,
then go to <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/signup.tsx" /> to set the email
and finally <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/onboarding.tsx" /> to get it.
