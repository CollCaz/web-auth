# Session Flash Messages

👨‍💼 Great work. Now we've got a pretty good pattern for handling toast
notifications.

🧝‍♂️ I found a bug! If you delete a second note, the toast notification doesn't
show up. This is because we're not setting an `id` for the toast
in <InlineFile file="app/routes/users+/$username_+/notes.$noteId.tsx" /> which
means the `useEffect` in `ShowToast` in <InlineFile file="app/root.tsx" /> won't
re-run (because all the other values are the same... dependency arrays 😩).

Because this isn't necessary for your learning of managing sessions, you can
safely leave this as-is and I'll fix it, or you can fix it before moving on if
you'd like. You could use the `noteId` as the `id` for the toast, or you could
generate one with `@paralleldrive/cuid2` which is already installed (that's what
I do).

In any case, I'm going to refactor the code a bit to make utilities out of this
we can use in other areas of the app in the future. In addition, I'm going to
just destroy the toast cookie altogether after we've read its value to save on
some bytes per request. If you're interested,
you can <DiffLink>review my changes</DiffLink>.

The APIs you'll be able to use in the future are:

```tsx
throw await redirectWithToast(
	'/somewhere',
	{
		title: 'Toast Title',
		description: 'This is a toast description',
		type: 'success',
	},
	{
		status: 201,
		// other response init stuff you wanna do
	},
)

// or, a lower-level API
const headers = createToastHeaders({
	title: 'Toast Title',
	description: 'This is a toast description',
})
return json({ status: 'success' }, { headers })
```
