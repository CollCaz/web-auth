# Session Unset

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/authentication-strategies-and-implementation/session-storage/improving-note-deletion-functionality-with-multiple-cookies" />

👨‍💼 We need to get rid of the toast value once we read it in the `root.tsx`.
Here's how the API works:

```tsx lines=5
session.set('key', 'value')
session.get('key') // 'value'

// then:
session.unset('key')

// then later:
session.get('key') // undefined
```

So we just want to add `unset` to <InlineFile file="app/root.tsx" line="57" />.

But wait! We also need to make sure we commit the session. Any time you change
the session, you need to make sure to let the client know otherwise it'll just
keep sending you the old version of the cookie.
