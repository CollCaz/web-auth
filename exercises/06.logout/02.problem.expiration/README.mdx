# Expiration

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/authentication-strategies-and-implementation/logout/implementing-remember-me-functionality-for-login-sessions" />

üë®‚Äçüíº For this app, we want the session to last 30 days, but only if the user
checks "remember me." Otherwise, we want the session to last only until the
user closes the browser.

Because of this, we can't configure our session storage object to have an
expiration (you can configure the
[`createCookieSessionStorage`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/utils/sessions#createcookiesessionstorage)
session storage object to have an expiration). Instead, we need to set the
expiration when we commit the session in the login and signup routes.

üê® To promote reusability, let's create a variable in a new
file <InlineFile file="app/utils/auth.server.ts" /> called
`SESSION_EXPIRATION_TIME` that's set to 30 days in milliseconds which is
`1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 30`. You can then make a `getSessionExpirationDate` which
returns a new date that is `Date.now() + SESSION_EXPIRATION_TIME`.

Then we can use that in our login and signup routes to set the expiration time
if the user has checked "remember me."

```ts
await sessionStorage.commitSession(cookieSession, {
	// Cookies with no expiration are cleared when the tab/window closes
	expires: remember ? getSessionExpirationDate() : undefined,
})
```

Go ahead and make those updates please.
