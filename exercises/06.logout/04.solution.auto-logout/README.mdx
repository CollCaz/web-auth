👨‍💼 Well, that was fun. Our app doesn't really need this so... Kellie? Can you
get rid of this?

🧝‍♂️ I'll take care of it 😈

Actually, I've been thinking about the codebase a bit and I want to make a few
more utilities and refactor some of the code. I'll take care of this while I'm
at it.

Also, now that we've got the ability for users to be logged in, I'm going to add
some pages for user settings.

As always, you
can <DiffLink>review my changes</DiffLink> if you're
curious. I'm not changing functionality. Just moving some things around.
