👨‍💼 Phew, that's a relief. Before now I had to close the browser and open it
again to logout 😅 What a pain. But now that I mention that, we should probably
think about making it so the auth session lasts longer than the browser session.

🧝‍♂️ I'm going to make a few changes to add a "remember me" checkbox to the login
and sign up forms. As usual, you
