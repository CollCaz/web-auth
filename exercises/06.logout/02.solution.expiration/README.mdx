👨‍💼 Great! Now we have a "remember me" checkbox that actually works. We have some
good control over our session expiration.

But what if the user's logged in and then their account gets deleted? Who knows!
We'd probably better handle that gracefully.

🦉 Depending on your use case, another thing you may consider is adding a
mechanism to refresh the user's session timeout time when they interact with the
site. For example, if they click a button or navigate to a new page, you could
refresh their session timeout time.
