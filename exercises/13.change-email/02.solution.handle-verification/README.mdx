# Handle Verification

👨‍💼 Great work. I think you're really getting the hang of this verification
stuff. Well that's good, because we're about to change it up a bit with
two-factor authentication!

🧝‍♂️ I'm going to implement all the routes for two factor authentication. When I'm
all done, we'll have the following routes:

- <LinkToApp to="/settings/profile/two-factor" /> - an interstitial page explaining
  what two-factor authentication is and shows an "enable" or "disable" link if it's
  enabled or disabled (you'll implement some of this logic in the exercise).
- <LinkToApp to="/settings/profile/two-factor/verify" /> - a page where the user
  can enter their two-factor authentication code to verify they can generate a code.
- <LinkToApp to="/settings/profile/two-factor/disable" /> - a page where the user
  can disable two-factor authentication.

And I'll add a link to this to <LinkToApp to="/settings/profile" />.
