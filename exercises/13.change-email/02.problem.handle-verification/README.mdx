# Handle Verification

👨‍💼 Alright, so now we're going to implement the `handleVerification` function
for changing the user's email. What makes this one different from the others
is instead of setting some stuff in the `verifySession` and redirecting the user
to another page where they can finish the action they're trying to take, we
already know the action they want to take (change their email), so we'll just
perform the email change right away.

Just make sure you send an email to the user's old email address letting them
know that their email address was changed. We've already got an
`EmailChangeNoticeEmail` component you can use for this. And this means you'll
need to get the user before the change so we know what their previous email was.

Good luck!
