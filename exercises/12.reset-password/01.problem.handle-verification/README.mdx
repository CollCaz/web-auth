# Handle Verification

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/authentication-strategies-and-implementation/reset-password/implementing-forgot-password-and-reset-password-flows" />

👨‍💼 With <DiffLink app1={-1} app2={0}>the changes</DiffLink> 🧝‍♂️ Kellie made, we
now have some nice utilities to streamline our verification process in general.
So in this exercise, you need to:

1. Add a `'reset-password'` verification type
   to <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/verify.tsx" />
2. Use some of the utilities
   from <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/verify.tsx" />
   in <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/forgot-password.tsx" /> to get the
   verification code set up to email the user
3. Implement the `handleVerification` function
   in <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/reset-password.tsx" /> to handle what
   happens after the user has successfully verified their ownership of the
   account.
4. Call the `handleVerification`
   in <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/verify.tsx" />.

Once your done, the user should be able to get to the password reset page.

Good luck!
