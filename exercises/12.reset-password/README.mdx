# Reset Password

I know I know, everyone should just use a password manager. But unfortunately,
not everyone does. So every application really needs a "forgot password" flow.
And thanks to our work with verifications so far, this is pretty simple.

You need a route where the user enters their username or email address. Then
generate a verification for the password reset, send the user the one-time
password to their email (just like the verification email we send when they
login), and once they submit that code, we can reliably trust they have
ownership of the account associated with that email address and we allow them to
reset the password for the account.

This is why having the user's email address is so critical. Their email address
acts as the final authority on ownership of the account. The user can always
recover their account so long as they have access to their email.
