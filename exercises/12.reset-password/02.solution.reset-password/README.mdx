👨‍💼 Awesome work! Now users who forget their passwords don't have to contact
support 😅

🧝‍♂️ I'm going to implement a new route at `/settings/profile/change-email` for
our next exercise. You can feel free to do it yourself if you like. It's a
form that takes the new email address (with all the regular
conform/validateCSRF/etc stuff), but I'm also going to get it ready for the
verification flow as well. Feel free to <DiffLink>check the diff</DiffLink> if
you want to see how I did it.
