üë®‚Äçüíº Super duper! Now we have a place to store all the configuration for the
different types of verifications we're going to be doing in this app. Let's get
started with one of those next!

  Note: in the video I show deleting the roles and permissions, however in the
  code we no longer do this. As demonstrated in
  [a previous exercise](https://auth.epicweb.dev/08/02/solution) is we update
  the migration seed script to create those and we don't use the seed script to
  create those (so we don't want to delete them either).
