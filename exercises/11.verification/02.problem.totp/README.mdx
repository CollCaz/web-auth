# Generate TOTP

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/authentication-strategies-and-implementation/verification/user-verification-workflow" />

üë®‚Äçüíº Now we're going to use [`@epic-web/totp`](https://npm.im/@epic-web/totp) to
generate a time-based one-time password. We'll want to make it valid for 10
minutes and use the SHA256 algorithm. We're going to use the defaults for
everything else (though you may consider using a bigger character set to
increase the entropy of the password).

Once we've got the TOTP generated and the verification added to the database,
we're going to want to send an email with the one-time password. We're already
sending them an email, so we'll just add the TOTP to the email we're already
sending.

Another cool thing the <LinkToApp to="/verify" /> route supports is the ability
to pre-fill the TOTP code based on search params. So in addition to sending the
code for the user to copy/paste or type in, we can also send them a link that
takes them straight to the `/verify` page with the code pre-filled. We can even
have the loader automatically validate the code without them having to do
anything.

<callout-warning>
	While auto-submission is a very handy feature, it can also be a problem
	because some anti-virus software will automatically open links in emails. If
	the link contains a TOTP code, then the anti-virus software will automatically
	validate the code and the user won't be able to use it. So you may prefer to
	not auto-validate the code or you may choose to not delete the code once it's
	been used and just let it expire.

In this exercise, instead of sending the user to onboarding with the email in
the `verifySession`, we're going to send them to `/verify` with some search
params and email them the code.

You'll be creating two URLs, one with the `code` which we'll email the user and
the other without the `code` which we'll use to redirect the user.
