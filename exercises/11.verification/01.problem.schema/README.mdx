# Verification Schema

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/authentication-strategies-and-implementation/verification/implementing-one-time-password-verification-with-database-storage" />

🧝‍♂️ I put together a <LinkToApp to="/verify" /> route for you. If you'd like to
build it yourself, feel free to
delete <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/verify.tsx" /> and make it yourself.
Or you can <DiffLink app1={-1} app2={0}>check the diff</DiffLink>.

👨‍💼 For this first step we're going to
update <InlineFile file="prisma/schema.prisma">the schema</InlineFile> for the
new `Verification` model. Make sure you delete all the verifications
in <InlineFile file="prisma/seed.ts">the seed</InlineFile> as well.

Once you've done those updates, you'll want to add a migration for the new
table.

```sh
npx prisma migrate dev --name verification
```
