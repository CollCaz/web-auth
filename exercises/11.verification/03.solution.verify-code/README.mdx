# Verify Code

üë®‚Äçüíº Great! Now I feel much more confident that our users are who they say they
are when they sign up for an account. Now that we have this implemented, we can
use this same plumbing for a new password reset flow!

üßù‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I'm going to rework things quite a bit for the next exercise. Here's what I'm
going to do:

- Move the post-verified logic from `/verify` to a `handleVerification` function
  in `/onboarding` which `/verify` will just call. This will allow us to keep
  the post-verification logic colocated with the part of the app that requires
  the verification which will make it much easier to maintain in the long-term.
  We'll be doing this for all our verifications so you may want to check this
  part out.
- Move some of the logic from `/onboarding` into utility functions in `/verify`
  so we can reuse that logic for other verifications.
- Update `/forgot-password` to allow the user to submit a verification code to
  reset their account password.
- Add a `/reset-password` route which is where the user will go after they
  verify their account ownership. You'll be doing some work here in the next
  exercise.
- Update our `sendEmail` functionality to more fully represent Resend's
  responses/errors and support sending react-based emails.
- Update the emails we have already to be react-based.

It's quite a bit of work. If you'd like to <DiffLink>check the diff</DiffLink>
feel free, and if you'd like to even do some of that work yourself, be my guest!
