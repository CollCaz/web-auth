# Onboarding

👨‍💼 This step is going to require a little bit more work. So, when a user is not
logged in, and there's no connection, we want to send them to onboarding so
they can create a new account. This means we're going to need to do a few
things:

1. In <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/auth.$provider.callback.ts" />, put
   the third party profile email into the `verifySession` along with the rest
   of the profile information and redirect to the `/onboarding/github` route.
1. In the <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/onboarding_.$provider.tsx" />
   `loader`, get the pre-filled information from the `verifySession` and use it to
   pre-populate the onboarding form (the form was already put together by Kellie
   🧝‍♂️ so you don't have to put that together).
1. Create a new `signupWithConnection` utility
   in <InlineFile file="app/utils/auth.server.ts" /> that takes the onboarding
   information (along with the verified `email` and `providerId`) and creates a
   new user with a connection.
1. Use the `signupWithConnection` utility in the
   <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/onboarding_.$provider.tsx" /> `action` to
   create the new user and redirect to the `/` route.

That should have you all set.

🧝‍♂️ I've already changed the `code`
in <InlineFile file="app/utils/providers/github.server.ts" /> so the GitHub user
is a new user without a connection, so when you click "Login with GitHub" it
should take you to onboarding. If you end up creating a connection and need to
test it again, update the `code` value to something else.
