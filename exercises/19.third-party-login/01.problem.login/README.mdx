# Login

üë®‚Äçüíº We want to allow users who have existing connections to be able to login with
those connections.

If you look at the `diff` for this step you may be intimidated, but this is
actually much smaller than it looks! Here's all you need to do:

1. Move logic from the <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/login.tsx" />
   `action` to a new reusable function called `handleNewSession`.
1. Update <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/auth.$provider.callback.ts" /> to
   create a session if there is no current user, but there is a connection and
   call `handleNewSession` with the new session.

That's it. You'll know this works when you click "Login with GitHub" and you get
logged in as Kody.
