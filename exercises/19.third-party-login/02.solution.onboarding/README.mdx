👨‍💼 Great work! Now we can get unauthenticated users through the OAuth flow so
they can be logged into our app.

🧝‍♂️ I'm going to make a small update to `handleNewSession` to allow for passing
a custom `responseInit` so you can set custom headers and stuff. I'm also going
to make a utility called `makeSession`
in <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/auth.$provider.callback.ts" /> to make it
easier to get users logged in there. You'll use it in the next exercise.
