# Remix Auth

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/authentication-strategies-and-implementation/oauth/integrating-github-authentication" />

👨‍💼 Let's start out by getting Remix Auth set up with the GitHub strategy. First,
you'll need to get the environment variables set in <InlineFile file=".env" />
and <InlineFile file="app/utils/env.server.ts" />.

Then we'll go to <InlineFile file="app/utils/auth.server.ts" /> to make our
authenticator instance with the `connectionSessionStorage` Kellie made for us
in <InlineFile file="app/utils/connections.server.ts" />.

Then you'll add the `GitHubStrategy` to the `authenticator` with
`authenticator.use`. If the GitHub profile doesn't have an email then redirect
to `/login` (this can happen if none of their email addresses are verified).

Kody 🐨 should be able to help you out from here. Good luck!
