# Connection Model

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/authentication-strategies-and-implementation/oauth/updating-prisma-schema-for-github-login" />

👨‍💼 We need to associate a user with their third party connections. Right now we
only have `github` as a provider, but we want to be able to add other third
party connections in the future for other social login options and potentially
Single Sign On (SSO) when we score a killer enterprise contract.

So, head over to <InlineFile file="prisma/schema.prisma" /> and add a
connections model.

You'll also be updating the <InlineFile file="prisma/seed.ts" /> file and you'll
want to create a migration with:

```sh
npx prisma migrate dev --name connections
```
