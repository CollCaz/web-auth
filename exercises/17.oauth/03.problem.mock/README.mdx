# Mock GitHub OAuth

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/authentication-strategies-and-implementation/oauth/simulating-third-party-dependencies" />

👨‍💼 Great, so Kellie 🧝‍♂️ put together a mock for all the GitHub APIs we call. To
enable these mocks, we need to update <InlineFile file=".env" /> to have the
GitHub variables prefixed with `MOCK_` (you may need to restart the app after
this change).

Unfortunately, that's not all we need to do to mock out the auth flow. See, the
problem is we get redirected to GitHub as part of the auth flow when we call
`authenticator.authenticate` in the `action` of `/auth/github`. But if we really
want to isolate our development and testing from third party services (we do),
we need to avoid that redirect.

So what we'll do instead is simulate what `authenticator.authenticate` does,
then redirect straight to `/auth/github/callback` without going through GitHub.

The most interesting bit to this is the `state` value which is used to prevent
cross-site request forgery. The idea is that the client (our app) generates this
state is sent to the identity provider (GitHub) and when the identity provider
sends the user back to the app, it sends the same state. So then the client
can use the state in the URL and compare it with the state in the cookie to make
sure they're the same. So you'll be generating a value for this and putting it
in a cookie as well as the redirect URL's search params.

Kody 🐨 will be in <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/auth.github.ts" /> to
help get this worked out for you.

Once you're done, you should be able to click the "Login with GitHub" button
on <LinkToApp to="/login" /> and it should pop up a the toast notification
saying we've authenticated with GitHub. You'll also get the mock profile logged
to the server terminal output.

Good luck!
