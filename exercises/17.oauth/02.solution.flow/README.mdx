# GitHub Strategy

üë®‚Äçüíº Great work. We've got the basic flow down. Now we need to decide what to do
with the user's profile now that we have it.

But before we get to that, we should probably make it easier to develop and test
this connection process...

üßù‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Speaking of mocking... I'm going to put together some mocks for the GitHub
API for you. It's more of what we did for the Resend APIs, albeit a little more
sophisticated. You see, we want to be able to simulate GitHub's APIs which means
we need to have some fake github users. We'll use `@faker-js/faker` for this,
but it's more complicated because we want to persist the github user's our users
connect to during development and testing so they continue to be there even if
we restart the server.

So I'm going to make a mini "database" (a `.gitignore`d json file) to store the
GitHub users we create.

Then I'll build out mocks for the following endpoints that are used in the
`GitHubStrategy`. Here's what the mocks will do:

- POST: `https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token` - looks up the GitHub user
  by the `code` param (or creates a new one) and responds with that user's
  `accessToken`.
- GET: `https://api.github.com/user/emails` - looks up the user from the access
  token in the `authorization` header and responds with that user's emails.
- GET: `https://api.github.com/user/:id` - looks up the user by the ID.
- GET: `https://api.github.com/user` - looks up the user from the access token
  in the `authorization` header and responds with that user's profile.
- GET: `https://github.com/ghost.png` - Responds with the image in
  `./tests/fixtures/github/ghost.jpg` (yes, it's a jpg even though the URL says
  png).

This will make it easy for us to develop and test this stuff locally without
relying on GitHub's APIs directly. However, I'm also going to make it easy to
use the real APIs when you want. So I'm going to use `msw`'s `passthrough`
utility to pass things through to the real APIs if our `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`
environment variable doesn't start with `MOCK_`. You'll fix that up in the next
step.

It's quite a lot and this is only one way to handle this, feel free to try it
yourself, or <DiffLink>checkout my work</DiffLink> if you'd like.
