# Redirect Cookie

Whenever the user is required to authenticate before performing an action, it
can be very jarring to not be placed right back where they left off. We handled
this in a previous exercise when we created a `redirectTo` query param on the
`/login` and `/signup` routes. However, things get a little more tricky when it
comes to third party auth.

The problem is that we lose the `redirectTo` query param when we redirect to
the third party auth provider. When the user finishes authenticating with the
third party, they get sent back to our callback URL. However, at that point, we
don't have the `redirectTo` query param anymore!

To solve this problem, we're going to use a simple cookie. This doesn't even
need to be very sophisticated because it's no big secret where the user's going.
So while we do want it to be secure with `HTTPOnly` and `SameSite` directives,
we don't need to worry about signing it or anything like that.

All we need to do is make sure we keep track of the `redirectTo` query param
that we're already sending to `/login` and `/signup`, get that into the cookie,
retrieve that from the cookie when we get back to our callback URL, and delete
the cookie when we redirect the user. Let's go!
