# Protecting Routes

Most web applications all have routes that you have to be authenticated to get
to. And it confuses authenticated users if they can get to the login/signup
routes. It's one thing to prevent this in the UI, but the real thing you're
trying to protect users from is the data that powers those pages. So while it's
nice for the user experience to prevent the user from naturally landing in a
place where they shouldn't be, it's even more important that you prevent them
from getting to the data through the data endpoints that you use to power those
pages.

The concept of protecting a route is pretty simple: Check the request, and if
it's coming from a user who doesn't have a valid session, then redirect them to
the login page.

In Remix, every route `loader` and `action` is an endpoint that can be called
directly, and so every private `loader` and `action` needs to have this
protection.

Often, a framework will allow you to protect an entire subset of routes in one
place. However, Remix does not yet have a feature for this
([it will eventually](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/discussions/9564)),
so it can feel a little tedious to protect every route individually. That said,
most of the time in a protected route you do need to get the user's session
anyway, and Remix has a nice way to build that into your routes thanks to its
ability to `throw` a `redirect` response. Which we'll take advantage of in this
exercise.

Personally, I like the explicitness (or maybe it's just Stockholm syndrome ðŸ˜…),
but if you want to protect a bunch of routes at once, you can do that by
adding it into your express server. Additionally, you can load the user in your
[app context](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/loader#context) so you
don't have to talk to the database manually in each request you need it.
