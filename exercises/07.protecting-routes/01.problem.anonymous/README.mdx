👨‍💼 We don't want authenticated users to get confused if they ever land on the
`/login` or `/signup` pages. So let's prevent that.

I want you to make a reusable utility
in <InlineFile file="app/utils/auth.server.ts" /> that automatically redirects
the user to the home page if they're already logged in.

🧝‍♂️ earlier you had written code in the `root.tsx` to get the user's ID from the
session. I created a handy utility in the `auth.server.ts` that does that for
you, so you can use that with your utility.

👨‍💼 Thanks Kellie. Once you've made the utility, then I need you to create
`loader`s in both <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/login.tsx" />
and <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/signup.tsx" /> which use your utility
to redirect the user to the home page if they're already logged in. You'll also
want to include this in the `action`s for good measure.

🦉 One note, we don't need any data for those routes. In that case, you do still
need to return a `json` response, so you can do this:

```tsx
export async function loader({ request }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
	// use your utility here...
	return json({}) // <-- just return an empty object
}
```

🐨 So start in <InlineFile file="app/utils/auth.server.ts" /> and then move on
to the other files in the files dropdown below.
